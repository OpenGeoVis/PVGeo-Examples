    "# *WIP:* Using the vistanterface Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a work in progress to demo how PVGeo can be used with `vista` for creating integrated visualizations directly in a Python environment. At this time, the 3D rendering is perfromed in a separate window and we have yet to embed the VTK rendering windowinf into some sort of Jupyter widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe someone reading this knows how to embed the rendering window into a widget?!?? If so, join us on [slack](http://slack.pvgeo.org) and let's collaborate!\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER:** This currently only works on the latest version of `vista` and `PVGeo`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -U vista\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *If not on a webserver*, you can have interactive 3D renderings by specifying `notebook=False` in the plotting routine. This will open a seprate window with the rendering.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal set forth for this notebook is to use a comination of Python packages to create an integrated visualization of some data and models for a specific project. These packages and their tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `discretize` for some file IO,\n",
    "- `SimPEG` inversion results for an inverted model\n",
    "- `PVGeo` for its post processing filters and data integration algorithms\n",
    "- `vista` to create the 3D renderings of the whole data scene\n"
