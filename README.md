# PVGeo Examples (Beta Stage)

This is a repository of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use
[PVGeo](https://github.com/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo) in a Python 3 environment with
the [**`vtki`**](https://github.com/akaszynski/vtki) Python package.

This is in very early stages so please explore around here until we find a neat
way to share these notebooks on a server.

Note that some features in the notebooks are experimental and showing off features
only present on `master` branches of the mentioned projects and might not be
fully deployed.


Launch these notebooks on MyBinder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo-Examples/master)
