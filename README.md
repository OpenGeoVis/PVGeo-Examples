# PVGeo Examples (Alpha Stage)

This is a repository of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use
[PVGeo](https://github.com/OpenGeoVis/PVGeo) in a Python 3 environment.

This is in very early stages so please explore around here until we find a neat way to 
share these notebooks on a server.

Note that some features in the notebooks are experimental and showing off features only
present on development branches of the mentioned projects.
